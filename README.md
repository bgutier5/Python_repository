# This is the repo that will be store my basic python files that I have written. 


### Some useful github notes ##
   * In order to push files you need to regenete the token every few attempts and updated in the local repo
   * Commands to update token in local repo

        git remote set-url origin https://<<newly_generated_token>>@github.com/bgutier5/Python_repository.git
     
     where you need to replace the <<newly_generated_token>> in the address every time.
    
  * Inside the folder there might be another REAME.md that contains examples of used tokens in the past. They are no longer valid!!
